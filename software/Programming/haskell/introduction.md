# Introduction

- **in purely functional languages, a function has no side-effects.**

- **referential transparency**, if a function is called twice with the same parameters, it's guaranteed to return the same result.

- **lazyness**, means that unless specifically told otherwise, Haskell won't execute functions and calculate things until it's really forced to show you a result. 

- **statically typed**, when you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on.
